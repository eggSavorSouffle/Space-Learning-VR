# Space-Learning-VR

VR App Idea: Space Learning There will be a room replicating a museum environment. In this room there will be a panel with a few buttons, On or Off, and the exhibit. The panel is controlled by the user, they have the ability to change the exhibit which will consist of a few planets/ stars. If the user clicks the on button for Earth, Earth will be projected in the exhibit. Beside the Earth there will be a window that will pop up with information about that planet. The user can control the rotation and zoom into the Earth. Users can walk around the room as well.
